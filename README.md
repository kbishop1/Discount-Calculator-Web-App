# Discount-Calculator-Web-App
This application uses fxml and java to calculate the cost of an item with the percent of discount. I also added in a 7% tax calculation as well. 

I made this application because my wife consistantly asks what the cost of an item will be with a discount after tax. This solves the problem easily. This can be expanded upon if necessary. In my general area 7% tax is expected but this should be easy to change if you want to use this app for your area.
