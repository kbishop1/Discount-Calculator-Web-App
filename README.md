# Discount-Calculator-Web-App
This application uses fxml and java to calculate the cost of an item with the percent of discount. 
In my general area 7% tax is expected but this should be easy to change if you want to use this app for your area.

I made this application in under an hour but this can be used as a template for similar simple applications.
